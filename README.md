# Worst Possible User Experience

Basically, this bot takes messages that people DM it, and reposts them in a discord server of **YOUR** choosing.

Example: I DM the bot "__send My balls are very itchy." The bot will now repost the sentence "My balls are very itchy" anonymously in a discord chat.

You MUST configure the bot though, add your own bot token in Program.cs, and change the guild ID and channel ID in commands.cs.

Originally made for the SS2 discord server. Have fun.
